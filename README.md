# Bolt

A launcher thats a fusion of the Ubuntu dash, the Gnome-shell overview and the classic Gnome 2 menu which replaces the overview. Recommend for use with a dock.

Bolt can be easily configured through http://extensions.gnome.org or via the semi-transparent square to the left of the search box.
