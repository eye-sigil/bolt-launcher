# Bolt Launcher

A launcher fusing the functionality of the Ubuntu dash, the GNOME Shell overview and the 
classic Gnome 2 menu. Recommended for use with a dock. Based off the original codebase of zac-barton.

### Future Plans

* Integrated overview-style window spread.
* Unity lens and scope support.
* Shell theme autosupport.
* Interface imporvements.
* Stability and speed fixes.
