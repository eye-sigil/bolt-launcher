Here you'll find some Gnome-shell themes that I've updated to include Bolt 
theming. Full credits to the original authors of these themes, I've just added
Bolt themeing.

If you are a Gneom-shell theme author and would like to include support for Bolt
see [here](https://github.com/zacbarton/gnome-shell-extension-bolt/wiki/Theming).

NOTE that to use these updated themes you need to have the original theme installed.
